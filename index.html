      Tips from a <strong id="Wilderness-Explorer">Wilderness Explorer</strong>
    </h1>
    <p>
      Hello there. Here are some tips coming from a Wilderness Explorer about
      what you should bring during your journey, and some places to visit as
      well.
    </p>

    />
    <p>
      The content you will see here will be similar to the greatest YouTube
      channel of all time, the
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/outdoorboys">Outdoor Boys</a>.
    </p>
    <p>America is a very <strong id="Big">big</strong> place.</p>

      title="YouTube video player"
      frameborder="0"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"

      allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    <p>
      <strong id="Alaska">Alaska</strong>, the largest state in the US, is home to some amazing nature and
      wilderness unlike any other state. Also the perfect spot to challenge
      oneself into becoming a true Wilderness Explorer, just like the Outdoor
      Boys. <br />
      But if you are a beginner at this kind of experience, I would suggest
      something a bit easier and not as punishing.
    </p>
    <iframe
      width="560"
      height="315"
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lwR8l6CI2h4?si=NiJyYRWNRHHPh1R7"
      title="YouTube video player"
      frameborder="0"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
      referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
      allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    <p>
      Not as dangerous and punishing, but still offers immaculate views, camping
      in the <strong id="Tetons">Grand Tetons National Park</strong> is a great
      option.<br />
      Even though it is free, due to the popularity, reservations usually happen
      at least a year beforehand.
    </p>
    <h4>Number 1 Tip to Always Keep in Mind:</h4>
    <p>
      If you are going hiking in the woods or mountains,
      <strong>ALWAYS</strong> bring <strong id="Bear-Spray">Bear Spray</strong>
      with you at all times.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hopefully, this has encouraged you to spend some time outdoors, and risk your
      life in some rather dangerous situations. That way, you will know what
      REAL fear is. <br>
      Jk jk...<br>
      But I hope that this inspired you to explore the wilderness in America
      and the world a bit more.
